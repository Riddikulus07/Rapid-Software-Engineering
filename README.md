# Rapid Software Engineering

## Overview

Welcome to the "Rapid Software Engineering" project! This initiative focuses on building a no code/low code platform, streamlining web app development. The primary objective is to reduce the coding and deployment effort through a code generation system, making software development more efficient.

## Key Features

### Code Generation

The project incorporates a robust code generation system, driven by a Java-based generator class. This class dynamically recreates files based on UML class diagrams, significantly minimizing manual coding efforts and enhancing efficiency.

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Developed using Spring Boot, providing a powerful and scalable Java-based framework.
- **Frontend:** Utilizes React for a responsive and interactive user interface.

### Robustness Measures

To ensure the reliability of the generated code, the implementation includes JUnit testing for the backend Java components and Docker for seamless containerization.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Riddikulus07/rapid-software-engineering.git
   cd rapid-software-engineering
   ```

2. **Run Code Generation:**
   - Navigate to the `generator` directory.
   - Execute the generator class to recreate files based on UML class diagrams.
     ```bash
     java -jar generator.jar
     ```

3. **Backend Setup:**
   - Open the `backend` directory.
   - Build and run the Spring Boot application.
     ```bash
     ./mvnw clean install
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

4. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Open the `frontend` directory.
   - Install dependencies and start the React application.
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

## Results

The successful implementation of the Java-based code generation component, coupled with Spring Boot and React, ensures the project's goals of rapid software development are met. The technology stack provides a robust and efficient platform for automatic code creation, minimizing manual coding efforts and improving consistency.

## Challenges Overcome

Throughout the project, the team navigated challenges such as ensuring compatibility with various programming languages and optimizing the code generation algorithm. The combined use of Spring Boot, React, and Java showcased adaptability and problem-solving skills.
